	"about": "<p>I'm a web developer living in Denver, Colorado, looking for local opportunities to build awesome things. Some of the larger projects I've worked on recently are listed <span class=\"mobile-only\">in the menu</span><span class=\"desktop-only\">to the left</span>; take a look and feel free to get in contact if you have any questions or would like to see references or code samples.</p><p>My skills are mostly centered around front-end development (HTML, CSS, Javscript), although I have extensive experience with PHP and SQL as well. I'm excited about the current trends in front-end development, from build tools to module systems to the seemingly endless train of new Javascript frameworks. Most recently I've been building things with <a href=\"https://vuejs.org\">VueJs</a>, and I have a few year's worth of experience with <a href=\"https://angularjs.org\">Angular</a> v1 as well. For styling I generally use <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss\">PostCSS</a>. For build tools, I'm a huge fan of <a href=\"https://webpack.github.io/\">Webpack</a>.</p>",
