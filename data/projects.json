		"details": "<p>Inline is designed around the age-old concept of a todo list, but one that is organized by users, and by 'teams' to which users are assigned. Tasks can be dragged to other users or teams, and are further organized into three lists: 'Current', 'On Hold', and 'Complete'. Tasks can be viewed in two primary modes, 'Team View' and 'Profile View'. Small teams of web developers are often required to juggle multiple tasks in multiple projects, and Inline displays these tasks in a straightforward way that allows all team members to be aware of who's working on what and when.
